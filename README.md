# Quantum-Deep-Learning

Implementation of the Quantum Dynamical Descent algorithm present in the paper "A Universal Training Algorithm for Quantum Deep Learning" by Verdon et al.
The algorithm was used for training a quantum neural network using te notion of a quantum perceptron suggested in "Simulating aQuantum Perceptron on a quantum com-puter" by Schuld et al, to solve the Xor problem.
Algorithm was implemented using IBMQiskit platform version 0.14.0.
Work done within the course "Quantum Computing" from University of Minho.
